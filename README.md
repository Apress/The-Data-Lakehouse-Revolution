## üìò About the Book

In today‚Äôs world of AI-driven insights, organizations need a platform that combines the **scalability of data lakes** with the **performance of data warehouses**. This book introduces the **data lakehouse paradigm**, built on **Databricks**, and shows you how to leverage it for **machine learning, generative AI, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

You‚Äôll move step by step through **data preparation, model building, deployment, and governance** with practical labs and industry examples.
